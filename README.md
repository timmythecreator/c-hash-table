# c-hash-table
Implementation of a simple hash table in C, supporting basic operations such as insertion, search, and deletion. The hash table uses open addressing with double hashing for collision resolution. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of hash tables and provides a basis for further optimization and extension."
